# Introduction

Study.io is an application used to connect users who share similar learning objectives. A user can chose from a variety of topics and either navigate to a pre-existing room or create a new one. Once in a room, the user is able to chat with other room members, asking or giving help, drop learning materials into a group stroage for all other members to access, or even set up events or goals.

#### Challenges that were unexpected
* Why was it a challenge
* What did you learn?

# Video Demo / Screen shot walkthrough of the app
* What were the user stories /  what was MVP (mention Minimal Viable Product)

# How does the app work?
* What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it?
* OR What are all the places the data travels?  What happens to that data?
* Optionally include a diagram
* How does the tech stack come together?

# Workflow and Key lessons
 specifically those related to: Agile, CI/CD, testing, working with external stakeholders, ticketing, and user stories.
* Your git workflow, style guides, commit guides, etc
* What did you learn from the process
* What were key takeaways from stand ups, code reviews, etc
* Writing tests
* Link to your trello board, discuss completed tickets

# Performance Optimizations

# What additional features do you plan to add, how do you plan to implement those features?
* Future refactoring?
* Additional dev ops considerations?
* UI/UX additions?
